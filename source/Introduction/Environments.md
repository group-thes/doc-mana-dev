# Production and Sandbox Environments
The development team at mana has designed a development environment suitable for third-party developers to allow trials before public release. They are divided into two environments as described below.

## Sandbox environment

<!-- โดยบุคคลภายนอกจะไม่สามารถเข้ามายุ่งเกี่ยวได้ -->

This creates a simulated environment that is close to the actual work. But there is a complete separation between the systems being released on the market. So that the development team can test the system independently without any impact on the actual use. This means that the test money during this time is not real money as virtual money to use for testing. And external users will not be able to access anything in this step. except the developer team itself. which developers who are interested in developing the system together with mana can do[Applying to become a developer](../Quickstarts/GettingStarted.md)can follow the steps

## Production environment

It works in an environment that uses all real data. This means that the money spent during this period will be real money used for applications on the store.
In order to bring the system to the public, the developer team must have [Tier that is Standard or higher](../Quickstarts/stepUpgrade_tier.md) Only then can the system be released to the public.

Therefore, from the aforementioned Once a developer has successfully applied to become a developer. The system can be built, designed and tested in a sandbox environment. After the test is satisfied and want to bring the system to market, the tier must be changed to Standard or higher in order to use the production environment.
