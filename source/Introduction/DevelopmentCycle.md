# Development life cycle
3rd party system development in conjunction with mana There are system development steps that are compiled in chronological order for each stage. This is to support the work process from the beginning of development. entering the test period to the release to the market for real use From the foregoing, the working cycle can be divided into the following main phases:

## Development)
It is a phase that allows developers to develop their own systems to test the systems that are possible to market or to meet market requirements. With all system developments taking place in this phase, external users will not be able to access any of them at this stage.

This phase works in a sandbox environment, so if testing the system in the application the developer needs  [Mana sandbox application](../Quickstarts/test_in_sandbox.md) Along with the developer's testing which after the system has been tested successfully To release the system to the public, it must be connected to the APIs to prepare it for market release.

## Pre-release
After the development phase has passed, before the system is developed into the market, the system will be put on hold during the pre-release phase, which is when all the real data is worked with in the production environment, but not yet. released to the public Therefore, if there is a system testing in an application, developers need to switch to Mana application in parallel with developer testing.

And if developers want to test the functionality at this stage, it can be done. The store that was built to test the system at that time will use the developer's service and will be charged in real money as written in the system. This includes collecting service fees for contractual contracts with mana and at the end of this phase of process testing. Funds paid into the system will be returned to the software company and the store that was created to test this process will be destroyed.

After the developers have successfully tested the system and want to bring the system to the public. Must be notified in order for mana to review and prepare for public release.

## Production
It is the period of the release of the system to the public. So that organizations, shops or people who are interested in that system can use it in full. This includes a service charge based on the service being used.
