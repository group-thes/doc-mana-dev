# Overview
**Mana application** It is a form of electronic wallet that can conduct personal, merchant, or corporate financial transactions. It is also a platform that allows external developers (3rd party) to develop their own systems together with mana.

for example If developers want to make applications related to coin washing machines. That is to order the washing machine to run automatically when scanning to pay. Therefore, from the above example, when a transaction occurs, the 3rd party will be able to recognize the transaction's information if it connects to a service that mana is open to run. The process of connecting to this service is done through an intermediary called [DevPortal](https://mana-sand-portal.developer.azure-api.net)

**DevPortal**
It is an intermediary that connects the data between the mana system and the developer or the developer's system back to the mana. provided that it is still within the scope of the agreement that has been set

After developers have successfully connected to the DevPortal and want to play around with the newly developed capabilities, they can play it in a sandbox environment. Publish service to prepare the system launch for release to the market for production.
